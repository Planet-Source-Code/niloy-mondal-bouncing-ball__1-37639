## ^Bouncing Ball^


</div>

### Description

I would like to thank Ben Doherty, I got the idea of using a timer from his code. This code show how to bounce a ball on the form. The code is very small and simple and commented. Has a quiet different approach, uses only one timer.

### Source Code

It is a small and simple code, but I had to zip it because when I copied it here, the code got all jumbled up. So I decided to provide a zip file.
